<p>The story of an online moblie game begins</p>
<hr>

<p>An advanced alien race called the "Precursors" was discovered in Russia so US and USSR began searching across the globe for more
Precursor ruins in order to study their technology. Highly radioactive substance that causes mutations in human DNA called "<i>Collapse Fluid</i>" <s>Just don't question it</s>
which created a disease known as "Euroky Low-Emission Infectious Disease" (ELID). In an attempt to stop the outbreak, and reduce leakage, a security team was tasked with destroying the facility's entrance, however the explosion ruptured tanks filled with Collapse Fluid,
spreading the substance further and into the atmosphere, where trade winds and air currents proceeded to spread it across the planet.

<p>Chaos quickly ensued throughout the world, and millions of people were killed or horrifically mutated and land contaminated by the fluid became uninhabitable,
causing a large influx of refugees and forcing the surviving nations to find habitable land and resources.
These problems led to tensions amongst the surviving nations, ultimately leading to a <b>World War III</b> that lasted from <i>2045 to 2051 see below for picture brought to you by mspaint</i></p>

<p>Before World War III, AI and robotic technology advanced greatly and with the need of manpower due to heavy losses caused by the Collapse Fluid spread,
Androids began taking over many facets of industry which led to the creation of "Autonomous Dolls", or A-Dolls in the year 2035. 
Androids with advanced AI and superior strength that look similar to humans and are capable of expressing emotions, and later T-Dolls in 2037, which were A-Dolls with combat software installed.
Which are now the breif story of the mopbile game </p>
